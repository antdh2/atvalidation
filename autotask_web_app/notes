I need to think of a way to dynamically generate all account types etc into a file from the picklist module
This should be able to be done under a settings page on frontend

1) enter login details
2) run picklist code:
create_picklist_module --username 'user@usernamespace.com' --password 'userpassword' atvar.py

3) Using the generated atvar.py use python to search for common strings and add them to custom dicts
